# Checklist

- [x] Detect and support both `apt` and `apk` package managers inside the helper utilities.
- [x] Translate Debian-specific dependency names to their Alpine/postmarketOS equivalents during installation.
- [x] Align cross-compilation toolchain translations so `apk` pulls `binutils-arm-none-eabi`, `gcc-arm-none-eabi`, `binutils-avr`, and `gcc-avr` without errors.
- [x] Refresh documentation to describe the new package manager support.
- [x] Ship an apk-aware KlipperScreen installer shim so X11 remains installable on postmarketOS alongside the updated Wayland guidance.
- [x] Inventory component installer dependencies and document the Debian âžœ Alpine package mapping, including missing ports.
- [x] Introduce init-system detection and mirror service management for systemd and OpenRC, updating every component to use the shared abstraction.
- [x] Add Phosh/Plasma Wayland presets to the KlipperScreen installer and generate launchers during installation.
- [x] Extend the Wayland preset helper with an Sxmo wlroots profile so msm8953 reference images launch KlipperScreen reliably.
- [x] Auto-detect built-in displays and pre-seed `KlipperScreen.conf` with size/orientation hints on first install.
- [x] Autostart KlipperScreen automatically on Phosh/Plasma desktops and OpenRC consoles without relying on systemd units.
- [x] Install and register a native OpenRC KlipperScreen service so standalone console installs boot directly into the UI.
- [x] Gate Moonraker update-manager's `managed_services` stanza behind the selected KlipperScreen autostart backend.
- [x] Teach the Moonraker dependency parser to reuse the Debian list when apk-based systems lack a dedicated entry and translate it on the fly.
- [x] Document postmarketOS-specific prerequisites for the init-service abstraction and Wayland presets in the README.
- [x] Defer the Wayland preset prompt until after the backend choice so X11 installs no longer see the question prematurely.
- [x] Default the KlipperScreen installer to the minimal dependency set and gate optional extras behind an explicit opt-in.
- [x] Replace KlipperScreen's NetworkManager install reboot with a manual reminder so unattended runs exit cleanly.
- [x] Detect NGINX configuration directory variants so web UIs install cleanly on Alpine/postmarketOS hosts.
- [x] Detect missing `grep -P` support on BusyBox-based systems, install GNU `grep`, and retry the Moonraker policykit helper automatically.
- [x] Detect nftables firewalls and offer guided allow-rule creation for Moonraker and web UI ports with selectable network scopes.
- [ ] Capture feedback from postmarketOS test runs and extend the compatibility matrix as needed.
- [ ] Automate KlipperScreen smoke tests on postmarketOS handsets/tablets to validate display presets after updates.
- [ ] Upstream missing Alpine packaging workarounds (e.g., `packagekit`, `libcamera-apps-lite`) to reduce custom steps.
- [ ] Coordinate with KlipperScreen maintainers on integrating the Wayland wrapper defaults upstream.
- [ ] Offer optional WireGuard provisioning so remote access can be secured without manual VPN setup.
