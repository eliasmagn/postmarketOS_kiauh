# Project Concept

KIAUH (Klipper Installation And Update Helper) streamlines the setup and maintenance of Klipper-based 3D printing stacks. This fork extends the original concept by ensuring that the helper also works on Alpine Linux derivatives such as postmarketOS. Detecting the available system package manager and translating dependency names keeps the installation flow consistent across distributions while preserving the familiar menu-driven user experience.

The project focuses on:

- Automating environment preparation for Klipper, Moonraker, and companion tools.
- Providing a resilient installation experience across multiple Linux families.
- Maintaining documentation that highlights platform-specific nuances for end users.
